# FusionOS
Custom OS made in C++
The OS has network options like you have in VMware Workstation so you can create virtual switches if you are on a wired network.
The OS will get more improvements over time, which include WPA2-Enterprise security on WiFi.
The interface is based on Windows and MacOSX as you have a taskbar at the top and a dock at the bottom.
